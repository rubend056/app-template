<div style="text-align:center">

# AppStack

This Template should compile into a server.js NodeJS app that serves the ReactJS WebApp static files as well as functioning as the API of the application.

Bundling a Full-Stack Application that includes API/WebApp/DB along with unit/integration tests, and their respective documentation.

My goal is to create the simplest template imaginable while also utilizing powerful and carefully picked concepts/libraries.

I imagine the test of time will let me know what works and what doesn't but I plan to do the most research and only include the reasonable bits.
